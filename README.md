## About
Ultimate Smash or Pass is a website that allows you to ask yourself a very simple question for each character you see. You can then see if you can be validated for your opinion or not based on what others think.

## ...But why?##
I made this website to learn about Node.js and SQLite. I thought this would be fun to make (and it was). I do not encourage the blatant objectification of characters and I hope creators will take their characters' appearance on this website with a grain of salt.

## I want these characters to be on this website!
This site is a work in progress and I would love to add more characters if I have the time. Feel free to suggest on the GitHub page. Though I can't guarantee that my lazy ass will uphold anything, so please don't expect too much. Right now I'm figuring out a way to automate the process first.

Characters with NSFW appearances will be hidden by default. You can allow the NSFW tag to see them. Though they will likely not be present at all because I am 17 and this might end up as a project I want to include in my college application. Oops!

## This character doesn't have correct information!
If you see a character with incorrect information, please press on the "Report" button next to their information and I will take a look at it as soon as possible.

## I'm not comfortable with my character being on this website. Can you please remove them?##
Sure, just contact me and I will remove them as soon as possible. Please give me the permission to announce its removal on this page so those suggesting new characters can see if it's been removed before.

## I want to donate!
If you would like to support the upkeep of the site, you can buy me a coffee here: https://ko-fi.com/sirsalmon

## I want to contribute!
The site is open source and you can find the code here. This IS a beginner project for learning purposes, so I hope you can excuse the mistakes and abominations that I've brought to life.
